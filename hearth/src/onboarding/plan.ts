/**
 * Turning the wizard's answers into a dashboard.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: answers plus a detection snapshot go in, a board and
 * a settings patch come out. The wizard (`wizard.ts`) only collects the answers
 * and draws the result — none of the decisions below depend on Obsidian, so all
 * of them are unit-testable, which matters because this is the one code path a
 * new user's very first impression of Hearth is built by.
 *
 * The two halves are deliberately separate:
 *
 *  - {@link planCards} decides *what board to build* — which cards, configured
 *    how, laid out where.
 *  - {@link applySetup} decides *what to change in settings* — the look, the
 *    behaviour, the integration wiring — and installs the board.
 *
 * so the review step can show the first without committing the second.
