// one-way mood ladder: there is no hunger, no age, no illness and no way to
// lose the pet — a quiet vault only makes it bored and then sleepy, and any
// activity wakes it straight back up. Every mood is *derived* on render from
// vault timestamps rather than simulated on a timer, so closing Obsidian for a
// month, or syncing data.json between machines, cannot desynchronise anything.
//
// The sprites are 16×16 character grids (no image assets): one shared body plus
// a per-species head, painted with a face for the current mood and emitted as a
// run-length-encoded SVG of at most a few dozen rects.
