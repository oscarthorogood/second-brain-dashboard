/**
 * The contract every card kind implements (issue #103).
 *
 * A card kind is one self-contained module, `src/cards/<kind>.ts`, that
 * exports a `CardDefinition`. The registry barrel (`src/cards/index.ts`)
 * collects them into one `CARD_DEFINITIONS` record, and every place that used
 * to enumerate kinds by hand — the render switch, the editor switch, the
 * add-card menu, layout-import validation, the live-redraw set, cloneCard —
 * derives from that record instead. Adding a kind means writing its module,
 * registering it, and adding locale strings; nothing else.

 * Something a card needs before it can show anything — a community plugin, or

 * the dependency was there, which made a third of the catalogue invisible: a
 * user with no Dataview never learned the Dataview card exists, and "why does
 * my friend have a Git card?" was unanswerable from inside Hearth. Every card
 * with a requirement already renders its own "install X" prompt when the
