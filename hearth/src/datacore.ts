/**
 * Wrap a Datacore query in the smallest JSX view that renders it: a live list
 * of links to whatever the query matched.
 *
 * This is what makes the card's no-code "Query" mode possible. Datacore's own
 * codeblocks are all script-based — unlike Dataview, there is no query-only
 * block to hand a bare query to — so Hearth generates the view around it. The
 * query is embedded as a JSON string literal, which quotes and escapes it
 * safely no matter what the user typed.
 *
 * `dc.useQuery` re-runs on every index change, so the list stays live. What a
 * row renders as depends on what Datacore returns, because its object types are
 * not uniform: pages and sections carry a `$link` (as do blocks with a block
 * id) and render as real Obsidian links; tasks and list items carry no link at
 * all, so their Markdown text is rendered instead — which is what makes
 * `@task and !$completed` useful here rather than a column of ids. Anything
 * else falls back to its path or id, so a row is never blank.
 *
 * The one place Hearth composes Datacore's UI rather than just handing it a
 * script, so it is also the one place a Datacore release can break this card
 * without changing anything Hearth calls directly. It touches exactly four of
 * Datacore's surfaces — `dc.useQuery`, `dc.List` (its `rows`, `paging` and
 * `renderer` props), `dc.Link` and `dc.Markdown` — and nothing else in Hearth
 * depends on them. If a card shows Datacore's error boundary after a Datacore
 * update while script cards still render, this function is the place to look.
 * Script modes pass through untouched and cannot be affected.
 *
 * @param query    the Datacore query, e.g. `@page and #project`
 * @param pageSize rows per page; 0 or omitted renders every result unpaged
