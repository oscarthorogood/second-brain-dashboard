 * Per-file icons from the Iconic and Iconize community plugins (#132).
 *
 * Neither plugin exposes an API for other plugins, so — exactly as with
 * TaskNotes in `cards/tasks.ts` — Hearth reads their stored state directly.
 * That state is private and can change shape in any release of theirs, so every
 * read here is wrapped and every failure degrades silently to Hearth's own
 * file-type icon. A broken read must never surface as a broken card.
 *
 * Two plugins, because the two are mid-handover: Iconize
 * (`obsidian-icon-folder`) is deprecated but still widely installed, and Iconic
 * is its spiritual successor. A vault can have either, both, or neither.
 *
 * Scope: Lucide icons and emoji. Iconize can also draw icons from downloaded
 * icon packs (Font Awesome, Remix, …), which are SVG blobs on disk — rendering
 * those means injecting third-party markup, so those files keep Hearth's
 * built-in icon instead.
