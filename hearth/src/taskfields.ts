 * a field is something the user builds — a name, a display style, and one or
 * more keys that feed it. A key reads either a frontmatter property or one of
 * the values Hearth parses itself, and can map each raw value to a nicer label
 * and a colour.
 *
 * While customization is off, none of this is consulted: the card renders the
 * fixed metadata it always has (see `renderLegacyTaskFields` in cards/tasks.ts).
