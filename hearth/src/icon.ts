/**
 * Hearth's brand mark: the four-facet crystal, traced from assets/icon.png
 * into four closed vector subpaths (one per facet, mirroring the transparent
 * gaps that separated the facets in the raster).
 *
 * Two variants are registered:
 * - the brand mark, filled with the raster's flat purple (#A179FF) so the
 *   default look matches the original PNG; and
 * - a themeable mark drawn with `currentColor` so Obsidian's normal icon
 *   theming applies. Its facets are inset ~1.5 units toward their centroids,
 *   widening the gaps so the four facets still read at ribbon/header sizes
 *   when everything is a single color.
 *
 * The content is sized to Obsidian's 0 0 100 100 icon viewBox.
